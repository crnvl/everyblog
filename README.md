# everyblog

> There's a blog about anything. If there isn't, there will be.

everyblog is a blog platform that serves and generates new blogs on demand, if not already available. This is not meant to be a useful tool, but rather just for fun and a proof of concept, as most blogs you encounter nowadays are ai-generated anyway. So instead of gambling around if a blog is actually written by a human, you can just be sure it's not by using everyblog!
Also fun for self-hosting, if you want a zero-effort blog that just works.
